            <p>
                Alec Bell is a trumpeter who I currently have no relevant professional details for.
                Nonetheless I shall make some up. Alec was born and raised in Des Moines, Iowa, where until
                the 8th grade he fervently pursued his initial passion of competitve horseshoeing. Once he
                realized there wasn't much money in this field, he made the incredibly prudent decision to
                switch to jazz performance in order to earn a stable income. He has played with everyone who
                has ever wanted to play with him, including with some who haven't. When not playing trumpet,
                Alec enjoys long beaches on the walk and the occasional grapefruit parfait.

                Jared Crider is a trumpeter who I currently have no relevant professional details for. But you know what? Jared loves to shoop de whoop all day long. In the mornings he whoops, and in the evenings he shoops. Sometimes late at night he's even been known to schmoop. But that's just jazz, baby.
